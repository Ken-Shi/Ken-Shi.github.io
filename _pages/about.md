My name is Ken Shi, I am currently a PhD Student in Department of Computer Science in University of Toronto. My research interests primarily lie in the field of **Computational Linguistics**. Specifically, I am interested in and have conducted work on language modeling, semantics, speech, and visualization. My current research topic is on evaluating Large Language Models' Long-text Capability. 

Academic Background
======
I finished my undergraduate study as an [Eng Sci](https://discover.engineering.utoronto.ca/programs/engineering-programs/engineering-science/) in University of Toronto in June 2023. I went through the curriculum of the [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/) option in the program and my research interest arose from there. During my undergraduate study I was lucky to work with [Professor Gerald Penn](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gpenn/) on a Project on Dialogue Systems sponsored by [iNAGO](https://www.inago.com/). The project was selected to receive [ESROP U of T Fellowship](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/research-and-work/summer-research/esrop-u-of-t-2/) in 2020 and a milestone of the work was first presented at [CSTFRS Workshop at ESSLLI 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/cstfrs-2021/). 

I finished my MSc study under Professor Penn in University of Toronto in January 2025. My master thesis concerns reconciling Large Language Model Evaluation with Semantics with the help of Visualizations. I have decided to continue my study as a PhD student in the same lab. My current research topic is on evaluating Large Language Models' Long-text Capability.
