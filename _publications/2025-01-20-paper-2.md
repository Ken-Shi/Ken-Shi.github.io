title: "Semantic Masking in a Needle-in-a-haystack Test for Evaluating Large Language Model Long-Text Capabilities"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-01-20-paper-2
excerpt: 'In this paper, we introduce the concept of Semantic Masking, where semantically coherent surrounding text (the haystack) interferes with the retrieval and comprehension of specific information (the needle) embedded within it. We propose the Needle-in-a-Haystack-QA Test, an evaluation pipeline that assesses LLMs’ long-text capabilities through question answering, explicitly accounting for the Semantic Masking effect. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that Semantic Masking significantly impacts LLM performance more than text length does. By accounting for Semantic Masking, we provide a more accurate assessment of LLMs’ true proficiency in utilizing extended contexts, paving the way for future research to develop models that are not only capable of handling longer inputs but are also adept at navigating complex semantic landscapes.'
